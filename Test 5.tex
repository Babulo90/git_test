\section{Introduction}

This document will include some math.

\subsection{Math Formula}

Mathematical equations can be created inline as $5*4=20$, and can include a number of different math symbols. such as $7\leq 10$, is true.

You can also put your equation on a separate line as \[5^2=25\] to call out the formula.

\subsection{Float:Equations}

My first result is shown in Equation~\ref{eq:minutes}, which shows the number of minutes ina day.

\begin{equation}
24*60=1,440
\label{eq:minutes}
\end{equation}

There are a lot of intersetingmath symbols that i can learn, as shown in Equation~\ref{eq:symbol},

\begin{equation}
 7^4+6*17\geq 13\cup X\alpha 13\exists \rightarrow nonsense.
\label{eq:symbols}
\end{equation}

\section{conclusion}
